## Overview

FlowState transforms how job seekers prepare for interviews by bridging the gap between what's on your resume and how confidently you can discuss it. Upload your resume and receive AI-generated talking points that enable you to speak about your experience professionally, proficiently, and confidently.

## The Problem

Modern job seekers face a critical challenge: Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) often filter out qualified candidates before human reviewers ever see their resumes. This forces applicants to load their resumes with keywords to pass ATS scans, but this strategy creates a new problem—you may not feel proficient discussing everything listed on your keyword-optimized resume.

## The Solution

FlowState solves this disconnect by:

- **Analyzing your resume** to identify all the skills, technologies, and experiences you've listed
- **Generating personalized talking points** for each item on your resume
- **Building your confidence** so you can articulate your experience clearly and authentically
- **Helping you enter a flow state** where interview preparation feels natural and productive

Whether you're uncertain about a technology you listed or need help articulating a past project, FlowState ensures you can speak confidently about every aspect of your resume.
